#Task 0
In this i have to print first record of and last record of calls
first one only takes unit time 
worst case O(1)
second one i first reverse it and then print the first one 
this one take O(n) time to reverse where n is length of input 
#Task 1
in this one total time=n(caluclate no distinct no in texts) + n(caluclate no distinct no in texts)
worst case O(n)
#Task 2
i am iterating over calls and using variable great to check the longest duration
if there is any which is greater than great then i update the value great and no 
worst time O(n) where n is input length
#Task 3
part A
 i am iterating over calls checking for parenthesis and no if i found then i store it in varialbe z
i used sorting  
worst time O(nlogn)
part B 
same as Part A iterating over every inputs and checking according to condition 
 worst case O(n)
#Task 4
 in this i first iterate over calls from calling section and mark its value as 0
 the after i iterate over answring section and mark it as 1
 then in text section for both and mark it as 1
 then again maintain an another directory and stored all remaining no whose value is 
 0 into new variable and i sorted it 
 in this i use telephone no as value in directory
time complexity 
 worst time n(iteration time )+nlogn time for sorting 
 O(nlogn)
