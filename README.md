# Unscramble-Computer-Science-Projects
In this project, I had completed five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. I had use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, I had performed run time analysis of my solutions and determine its efficiency.
